# About MegaMod
MegaMod was created as a test project for a friend to see if I could create custom cloud heights in MCP. While, I was successful in my journey I decided that I wanted more to happen with the mod instead of being just one thing, a cluster of things. I had decided to next add FoV, then zooming because I liked optifine's zoom but it wasn't good enough for my standard, I kept adding and adding until I finally reached a point where I had an extensive mod made from MCP-LTS that covered all the standard features of a mod today.

I ended up remaking MegaMod into a fabric mod, remaking it's features in it's entirety and attempting to make the mod compatible with other mods, so far MegaMod is commonly used for it's rich feature list and extensive support in the OldHaven-Network more specifically, and I plan to continue adding to it constantly to make it one of the most advanced, yet simplistic mods that doesn't add gameplay changing features in the legacy community.
