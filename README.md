# MegaMod-Mixins
After months and months of development, it's finally ready for a proper release 

## Setup for MegaMod-Mixins
######  [Taken From Here](https://github.com/js6pak/beta-example-mod)
1. Edit build.gradle and mod.json to suit your needs.
    * The "mixins" object can be removed from mod.json if you do not need to use mixins.
    * Please replace all occurences of "modid" with your own mod ID - sometimes, a different string may also suffice.
2. Run the following command:

```
./gradlew idea
```
